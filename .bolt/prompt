Property and Restaurant Management Website – Project Overview
🔧 Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
→ We are using React to build a fast, interactive, and scalable frontend. TypeScript is used to add static typing, improve code quality, and reduce runtime errors.

Backend: Node.js with TypeScript
→ The backend is built using Node.js for efficient, event-driven server-side logic. TypeScript enhances maintainability and provides better tooling with IntelliSense and type safety.

Database: PostgreSQL
→ A PostgreSQL database is used for storing and managing structured data such as property listings, restaurant menus, orders, bookings, inventory, etc. It is reliable, supports complex queries, and integrates well with Node.js.

Authentication: No user authentication is implemented at this stage.
→ For initial testing and development, authentication is disabled. However, a default login credential is provided to access admin functionalities.

Username: admin

Password: admin

🌐 Website Description – Property and Restaurant Management System
This is a feature-rich web application designed to manage both hospitality (property) and restaurant operations from a single platform. The system allows businesses to handle property listings, bookings, room configurations, restaurant menus, orders, billing, and inventory – all in one place.

🔐 Login & Navigation Flow
The website begins with a landing page featuring a "Sign In" button.

When the user clicks on the Sign In button:

A login form appears where the user must enter the demo credentials:

Username: admin
